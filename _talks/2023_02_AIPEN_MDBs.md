## AIPEN Proposal Abstract: Member State Hierarchies at Multilateral Development Banks

Unlike other international organisations, multilateral development banks (MDBs) make no pretence to the equality of their member states. Positional dissatisfaction within this system emerges not from inequality, so the prevailing wisdom goes, but from inequity—a mismatch between a state’s de jure vote share and its broader economic capacity. In much of the literature, this inconsistency is cited as a contributing factor to emerging market and developing economies’ (EMDEs) discontent at established MDBs, and ultimately to the creation of EMDE favourable alternatives.

And yet despite the apparent importance of member state hierarchies at MDBs, to date there has been no systematic enquiry into the phenomenon. I suggest that the relationship between a state’s organisational status and its de jure vote share is far from clear. Research on UN system and multilateral security organisations, for example, suggests that indicators of de facto organisational status—emerging from disparate patterns of diplomatic engagement—better attest to organisational hierarchies than de jure structural indicators or naïve indicators of global ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ power.

In this paper I assess whether this is also the case at three MDBs. I compare, via a Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD), representations of de facto, de jure, and naïve hierarchies at the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and African Development Bank. This analysis (re)emphasises the importance of multilateral diplomacy, undermining the common assumption that materially dominant states necessarily translate their advantage into organisational prestige, and provides a higher resolution picture of MDB hierarchy than vote share alone.
