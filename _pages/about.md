##### [IAEA Hierarchies Conference Paper](/talks/2022_09_APSA_IAEA) - Australian National Unviersity, Canberra - [APSA Conference September 2022](https://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/events/2022-apsa-annual-conference)
I argue that divergent patterns of engagement at the Agency, rather than variations in material capacity, act to define and produce status inequalities between member states. Illustrating and analysing the IAEA hierarchy via Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) methods, I demonstrate the utility of FAMD in better preserving not only rankâ€”a state's position in the hierarchy, but also the relative distance between ranks. This, I suggest, is a significant advantage in the study of organisational hierarchies and offers improvement on existing approaches.
